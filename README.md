## Approximating u(x) Such That u′′(x) + 3u′(x) + 2u(x) = 4x^2, u(1) = 1, u(2) = 6
Using the fact that the following equation:
u′′(x) + P(x)u′(x) + Q(x)u = f(x), u(a) = α, u(b) = β
can be rewriten as: 
(**) (1 + h/2 * P_i)u_(i+1) + (−2 + h/2 * Q_i)u_i + (1 − h/2 * P_i)u_(i−1) = h^2f_i
where: h = (b - a) / N
Where P(x) = 3, Q(x) = 2, a = 1, b = 6
### (a) with N = 10
### (b) with N = 40
